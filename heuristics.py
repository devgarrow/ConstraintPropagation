'''This file will contain different constraint propagators to be used within
   the propagators

var_ordering == a function with the following template
    var_ordering(csp)
        ==> returns Variable

    csp is a CSP object---the heuristic can use this to get access to the
    variables and constraints of the problem. The assigned variables can be
    accessed via methods, the values assigned can also be accessed.

    var_ordering returns the next Variable to be assigned, as per the definition
    of the heuristic it implements.
